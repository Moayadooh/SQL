/*1. Write a query to display the system date. Label the column as Date.
Note: If your database is remotely located in a different time zone, the output will be the date
for the operating system on which the database resides.*/

/*2. The HR department needs a report to display the employee number, last name, salary, and
salary increased by 15.5% (expressed as a whole number) for each employee. Label the column
New Salary.*/

new salary. Label the column Increase.*/

/*5. Write a query that displays the last name (with the first letter in uppercase and all the other
letters in lowercase) and the length of the last name for all employees whose name starts with
the letters â€œJ,â€? â€œA,â€? or â€œM.â€? Give each column an appropriate label. Sort the results by the

/*6. The HR department wants to find the duration of employment for each employee. For each
employee, display the last name and calculate the number of months between today and the
date on which the employee was hired. Label the column as MONTHS_WORKED. Order your
results by the number of months employed. Round the number of months up to the closest
whole number.*/

characters long, left-padded with the $ symbol. Label the column as SALARY.*/

/*8. Create a query that displays the first eight characters of the employeesâ€™ last names and indicates
the amounts of their salaries with asterisks. Each asterisk signifies a thousand dollars. Sort the
data in descending order of salary. Label the column as
EMPLOYEES_AND_THEIR_SALARIES.*/

/*9. Create a query to display the last name and the number of weeks employed for all employees in
department 90. Label the number of weeks column as TENURE. Truncate the number of weeks
